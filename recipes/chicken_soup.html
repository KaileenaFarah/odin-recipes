    <p><em>The best chicken soup does not need much — just tender poached chicken, hearty winter vegetables, and fresh herbs simmered in chicken broth. 
        It is a simple combination that is a cozy hug for your taste buds and the best kind of immunity boost.</em></p>

    <p>I have been making this exact chicken soup for over a decade now. It is my go-to recipe when the cold weather strikes and I am craving something light, brothy, nourishing, and warm. 
        And while many chicken soup recipes often contain pasta noodles, they are definitely not needed. 
        I swap those out for parsnips which are equally filling, but add a deliciously sweet flavor that works so well with the fresh herbs.</p>
    <p>What is the secret to making a phenomenal chicken soup? My answer is to keep the ingredient list minimal and simple. 
        This chicken soup is jam-packed with a ton of nutrient-dense vegetables such as carrots, parsnips, leek, celery, and onion, plus fresh herbs.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>chicken breast</li>
        <li>vegetables - carrots, leak, celery, onions, garlic</li>
        <li>fresh herbs</li>
        <li>chicken broth</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <p><li>Saute the veggies. Heat the oil in a large pot on medium heat. Add the carrots, parsnips, celery, leek, and onion to the pot and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Then, add the garlic, salt, and pepper, and stir for another minute.</li></p>
        <p><li>Poach the chicken. Add the thyme, tarragon, bay leaf, chicken, and broth to the pot. Bring everything to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cover the pot. Simmer the soup for 15 minutes, or until the chicken is fully cooked. You can also use an instant-read thermometer to see if the chicken has reached 165°F. </li></p>
        <p><li>Shred the chicken. With tongs, remove the chicken to a cutting board and gently shred the chicken with two forks. Place the shredded chicken back into the pot and simmer for an additional 1 to 2 minutes.</li></p>
        <p><li>Garnish and serve. Remove the sprigs of thyme, tarragon, and bay leaf. Don not forget to garnish the fresh parsley and black pepper before serving. Those little additions will make a difference!</li></p>
